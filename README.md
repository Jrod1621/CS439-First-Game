# CS439-First-Game
Pong game with inclusions for first game project in CS439

Paddle movement: W and S, Up arrow and down arrow

Basic pong game that includes color changes, sound effects, player name retreival, and basic collision, I used Game Programming Pong as a overview and basically translated it into python and added features. 

Basic collision shapes such as circle and rectangle sprites are used and once the ball intersects with the paddles pixels the speed of the ball will be reversed to simulate a "hit"

Special features Included are the ball color changing upon score, name input, message at the end of the game, and sound effects for hits (slight lag)

Playing: 

  Make sure you are in the venv directory of the project, then run in the terminal: pip install pygame

  The game should be ready to be ran with python main.py 

  Name Input:

I'll leave the end screen as a suprise once a player reaches 7
